## Description

This past weekend, we attended the OpenAlt conference in Brno. Me and a few other (Adam, Petr, Vojta) guys
from [@bastlirna](https://macgyver.siliconhill.cz) were well-represented, with each of us giving a talk on different
topics.

In addition to our talks, we organized an unofficial event called "**Show Us Your PCB Prototype**". The purpose of this
was to showcase our electronic creations, both at the prototype stage and as official products that had previously
been prototypes. We were looking to highlight our (and also participant's) worst electronic creations that still
managed to serve their purpose.
