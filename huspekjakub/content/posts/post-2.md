## Description

On October 7-8, 2023, our hackerspace participated in the LinuxDays 2023 event. We had a booth where we showcased our
projects and interacted with visitors.

One of our members, Adam, presented (and made as well) a development board featuring the CH32V003 microcontroller, which also served as a
visitor badge. Attendees could either purchase it as a kit or assemble it with our assistance.
