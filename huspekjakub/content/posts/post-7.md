## Description

One weekend in April, we went with the group from our hackerspace [@baslirna](https://macgyver.siliconhill.cz/) to the
only European event organized by [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io). It wasn't our first visit, we attended the event
last year as well. Similar to last year, we stayed at a hostel on the busiest street (Warschauer St.) in Berlin. The
event took place at [MotionLab](https://motionlab.berlin/) in the center of Berlin.

The event featured numerous lectures, lightning talks, and workshops. Additionally, there was food, music, camaraderie,
badge hacking, and the general excitement surrounding a Hackaday event.

Like every event, there was badge hacking. At this event, the badge [Vectroscope](https://hackaday.com/tag/vectorscope/)
was used. There was also a daily competition, which was announced at the end of the first day.
