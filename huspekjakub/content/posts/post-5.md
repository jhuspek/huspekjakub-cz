I had the awesome opportunity to present at the OpenAlt 2023 conference.
The talk was all about feature flagging - something I've been deeply involved in while working on our existing systems.

### Name

Unleash your feature flags

### Abstract

Did you realize that microservices aren't a prerequisite for implementing feature toggles? Surprisingly,
using feature toggles isn't all sunshine and roses. They come with their own set of pitfalls. But fear not! We'll
navigate through these intricacies and introduce you to the invaluable tool Unleash (an open-source feature flag
management tool), which will shown during the session.
