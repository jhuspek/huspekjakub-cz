## The perfect match!

As an open-source company, they aim to improve the lives of developers. We build tools to empower developers and
simplify their work. Our goal is to assist every developer in delivering high-quality software quickly.

## Why did I join?

I have several reasons for being interested in this. First of all, we use the product ourselves, and I believe
it is currently one of the most advanced options available. Secondly, I have been involved in various hardware
communities for a long time and now I am looking to gain experience from open communities focused on software. I am
particularly interested in open source software and its overall background, as I have not had any experience with it
beyond being a user.
