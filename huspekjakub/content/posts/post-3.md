## Description

I co-organized a meetup at T-Mobile's Magenta Experience center, which is a modern shop with a range of programs. The
event was hosted by **CNCF** and the **Cloud Native Prague** community group. It was held both in-person and virtually.

The program consisted of two separate talks, which you can watch on YouTube, followed by a networking session.
Refreshments were provided throughout the event.
