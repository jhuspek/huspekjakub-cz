I am glad that I had the chance to present
at [KCD Czech Slovak 2024](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-czech-slovak-presents-kcd-czech-slovak-2024/).
As usual, I exceeded the time limit, forgot to mention several important points, and at times, my delivery was a bit confusing.

Nevertheless, it's always a valuable experience to speak in front of a group of strangers and try not to disappoint
them, even though it can be really stressful.

### Name

Unlocking the True Power of Feature Flags

### Abstract

Feature flags are more than just IF code switches; they're a crucial part of modern development strategies. However,
using them incorrectly can lead to significant issues, affecting your application and business. This talk provides
insights into effective feature flagging, highlighting common mistakes, and offering guidance on the best tools for
management.

We'll dive into Unleash, an advanced open-source tool for feature flag management, and discuss the evolving OpenFeature
specification aimed at standardizing feature flag practices.
Learn how to harness the full potential of feature flags to benefit your development workflow.
